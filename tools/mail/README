Email Gateway
=============

Receiving Emails
----------------

The script mudmail/recmail.py can be called from an MTA. An Exim4 transport
rule would look like this:

    mud_transport:
        driver = pipe
        user = mud
        group = mud
        message_size_limit = 25000
        command = /MUD/mudrpc/tools/mail/mudmail/recmail.py
        log_fail_output = true
        return_fail_output = true
        umask = 027

It expects the email on stdin, the environment variable LOCAL_PART should
contain the local part of the recipient (the name before @hostname) and
SENDER should contain the full sender's name.

The method filter_spam() can be adapted to determine whether it's okay to
check a user's mails for spam.

On the LPC side /secure/rpc/mail.c (in the mudrpc/lpc directory) gets its
receivemail() function called 


Sending Emails
--------------

To send an email call "/secure/rpc/mail"->sendmail(). The call is forwarded
to mudmail/mailapp.py. There some header entries are added and the mail
is sent to the local MTA.
