Usenet Gateway
==============

These scripts are designed for use with the INN2 usenet server.
So you need a working INN2 setup  INN2 should have been compiled
with perl support.


Authorizing MUD users
---------------------

To your /etc/news/readers.conf add the following lines:

    auth "everyone" {
        perl_auth:   /MUD/mudrpc/tools/news/perl/inn_auth.pl
        perl_access: /MUD/mudrpc/tools/news/perl/inn_access.pl
    }

inn_auth.pl will check the username/password, inn_access.pl
asks get_newsgroups() in /secure/rpc/news (in the /mudrpc/lpc
directory) for the newsgroups the user is allowed to read and write.


Accepting posts from MUD users
-------------------------------

perl/filter_nnrpd.pl is a filter script that should be put into
/etc/news/filter (or whatever filterpath is configured in /etc/news/inn.conf),
which changes the sender name to the authenticated user, and adds
a few header entries (X-Muduser and X-Mud) to the post.


Receiving Usenet posts
----------------------

Add the following entries to /etc/news/newsfeeds to call some python scripts
upon the arrival of posts:

    mud!/mud-news\
        :!*,mud.*,de.alt.mud\
        :Tc,Acp,Wn:/MUD/mudrpc/tools/news/mudnews/newsclient.py

    mudcancel!\
        :!*,control.cancel\
        :Tc,AC,Wn:/MUD/mudrpc/tools/news/mudnews/cancelclient.py

"mud-news" should be renamed to something unique for your MUD.
It's the 'Path' entry for outgoing posts. mud.* and de.alt.mud
are the newsgroups that will be relayed into the MUD. Modify
it according to your needs.

Both python scripts are very lightweight, the just relay the call to
the main daemon (/mudrpc/tools/daemon/muddaemon), which in this
case does not relay the call into the MUD but executes some code
itself and calling then functions in the MUD with the result.
The RPC FIFO (/MUD/rpc/news in the example) should be accessible
to both the news (inn2) and the daemon user.

In the MUD finally /secure/rpc/news->importnews() and cancelnews()
is called.


Sending Usenet posts
--------------------

To send an email call "/secure/rpc/news"->exportnews() (deletenews() for
cancelling a post). The call is forwarded to mudnews/newsapp.y
(class InternalNews). There you can adapt the added header entries
to your needs. The "Path" entry should be the same as is excluded
in the newsfeeds entry (see above in 'Receiving Usenet posts').
